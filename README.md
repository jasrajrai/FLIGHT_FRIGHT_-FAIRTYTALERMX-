# FLIGHT_FRIGHT_-FAIRTYTALERMX-
For some reason the sound files fail to load. I have tried previous examples I had from last year which failed to load aswell. However, the commands are still there, but they are commented out. The final result was a looping soundtrack which sped up the longer you played. All sound files are also attached.
